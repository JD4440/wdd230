        <h2>Our Story</h2><br>
        <p>Maria and Carlos started Bountiful Foods after being inspired by their daughter, Sofia. She wanted to do a lemonade stand one summer, but since so many other kids were doing it she thought it would be fun to offer something different. Sofia with her parents help asked a friend if they could buy some of his fresh fruit from his farm, they helped her set up a smoothie stand and Sofia offered fresh made smoothies. The stand was a huge hit. Sofia enjoyed hosting the stand for the weekend then decided that she would rather play with her friends, but it had sparked an idea in her parents. Maria and Carlos started with a single food truck and drove the local coast selling smoothies that were made with produce from local businesses and have since branched out adding a stationary store where they work, and a full line up of food trucks. </p>
